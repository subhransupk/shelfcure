```

## üìù STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION

### **STEP 1: Add Staff Member**

**What Happens:**
- Store Manager goes to Staff Management ‚Üí Add Staff Tab
- Fills in staff details (name, email, phone, role, department, salary, etc.)
- Clicks "Add Staff"

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Staff record is created in `Staff` collection
- Employee ID is auto-generated (e.g., PHR001 for Pharmacist)
- ‚úÖ **NEW FIX:** Salary configuration is automatically created!

**Database Records Created:**
1. `Staff` document
2. `StaffSalaryConfig` document (with default salary structure for the role)

---

### **STEP 2: Salary Configuration (Auto-Created)**

**What It Contains:**
- **Base Salary:** Based on role (Pharmacist: ‚Çπ18,000, Cashier: ‚Çπ10,000, etc.)
- **Allowances:**
  - HRA (House Rent Allowance) - 30-40% of base salary
  - Transport Allowance - ‚Çπ800-‚Çπ2,000 fixed
  - Medical Allowance
  - Dearness Allowance (DA)
- **Deductions:**
  - PF (Provident Fund) - 12% of base salary
  - ESI (Employee State Insurance) - 0.75% of gross salary
  - TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)
- **Overtime Configuration:**
  - Overtime rate: 1.5x hourly rate
  - Max overtime: 60 hours/month
- **Working Hours:**
  - Daily: 8 hours
  - Weekly: 48 hours
  - Monthly: 208 hours (26 days √ó 8 hours)

**‚úÖ FIX #1:** Salary configs are now auto-created when staff is added!

---

### **STEP 3: Mark Attendance**

**What Happens:**
- Every day, Store Manager goes to Attendance Tab
- Marks each staff member as:
  - ‚úÖ **Present** - Full day worked
  - ‚ùå **Absent** - Did not come to work
  - ‚è∞ **Late** - Came late but worked full day
  - üïê **Half Day** - Worked only half day
  - üèñÔ∏è **On Leave** - Approved leave
- Records check-in and check-out times
- System automatically calculates working hours and overtime

**Behind the Scenes:**
- `StaffAttendance` record is created for each staff member for each day
- Working hours are calculated: `checkOut - checkIn`
- Overtime is calculated: `workingHours - standardHours (8)`
- Data is stored for payroll calculation

**‚úÖ FIX #8:** System now validates that attendance exists before processing payroll!

---

### **STEP 4: Process Payroll (The Magic Happens Here!)**

**What Happens:**
- Store Manager goes to Payroll Tab
- Selects month (e.g., January 2025)
- Clicks "Process Payroll" button

**Behind the Scenes (Detailed Calculation):**

#### **A. Fetch Attendance Data**
```
- Get all attendance records for the month
- Count working days (Present + Late + Half Day)
- Count absent days
- Count half days
- Sum total working hours
- Sum overtime hours
```

#### **B. Calculate Base Salary**
```
Base Salary = Salary Config Base Salary
Example: ‚Çπ18,000 (for Pharmacist)
```

#### **C. Calculate Allowances**
```
HRA = Base Salary √ó 30% = ‚Çπ18,000 √ó 30% = ‚Çπ5,400
Transport = Fixed ‚Çπ1,500
Medical = ‚Çπ0 (if not enabled)
DA = ‚Çπ0 (if not enabled)

Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours √ó Hourly Rate √ó 1.5
Hourly Rate = Base Salary / (26 days √ó 8 hours) = ‚Çπ18,000 / 208 = ‚Çπ86.54
Overtime Pay = 10 hours √ó ‚Çπ86.54 √ó 1.5 = ‚Çπ1,298

Total Allowances = ‚Çπ5,400 + ‚Çπ1,500 + ‚Çπ1,298 = ‚Çπ8,198
```

#### **D. Calculate Gross Salary**
```
Gross Salary = Base Salary + Total Allowances
Gross Salary = ‚Çπ18,000 + ‚Çπ8,198 = ‚Çπ26,198
```

#### **E. Calculate Deductions**
```
PF = Base Salary √ó 12% = ‚Çπ18,000 √ó 12% = ‚Çπ2,160
ESI = Gross Salary √ó 0.75% = ‚Çπ26,198 √ó 0.75% = ‚Çπ196
TDS = ‚Çπ0 (if below threshold)

Absent Deduction = (Base Salary / 26 days) √ó Absent Days
Absent Deduction = (‚Çπ18,000 / 26) √ó 2 = ‚Çπ1,385

Total Deductions = ‚Çπ2,160 + ‚Çπ196 + ‚Çπ1,385 = ‚Çπ3,741
```

#### **F. Calculate Net Salary**
```
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Total Deductions
Net Salary = ‚Çπ26,198 - ‚Çπ3,741 = ‚Çπ22,457
```

#### **G. Create Payroll Record**
```
- Create StaffSalary document with all calculations
- Status: "Pending" (not paid yet)
- Approval Status: "Draft"
- Store all breakdown details
```

**‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED:**
- ‚úÖ FIX #2: Improved salary calculation with proper pro-rating
- ‚úÖ FIX #3: Allowances calculated on full base salary
- ‚úÖ FIX #4: Overtime pay calculated properly
- ‚úÖ FIX #5: Deductions based on base salary
- ‚úÖ FIX #6: Absent deduction calculated correctly
- ‚úÖ FIX #7: Pre-save middleware calculates final totals

---

### **STEP 5: Pay Salary**

**What Happens:**
- Store Manager reviews payroll records
- Clicks "Mark as Paid" button for each staff
- Selects payment method (Cash/Bank Transfer/Cheque/UPI)
- Enters payment reference (if applicable)

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Payroll status changes from "Pending" to "Paid"
- Payment date is recorded
- Payment method and reference are stored
- Approval status changes to "Approved"
