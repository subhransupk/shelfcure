# ShelfCure Discount Selection System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a manual discount selection system for the ShelfCure sales page, mirroring the tax selection functionality. Store managers now have complete control over when and which discounts to apply to each transaction.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Discount Selection UI (✅ Newly Implemented)
**Location**: Store Panel Sales → POS Tab
- **"Apply Discount" Checkbox**: Allows store managers to choose whether to apply discount
- **Conditional Discount Dropdown**: Shows when checkbox is checked, populated with active discount types
- **Manual Discount Input**: Available as fallback when no discount type is selected
- **Discount Information Display**: Shows selected discount details (value, max cap, description)

### 2. Enhanced Discount Calculation Logic (✅ Modified)
- **Selective Discount Application**: Only applies discount when "Apply Discount" is checked
- **Removed Automatic Application**: Eliminated auto-apply discount rules logic
- **Manual Control**: Store managers choose per transaction whether to apply discount
- **Fallback Manual Input**: Manual percentage discount when no discount type selected
- **Store-Level Caps**: Maintains existing discount percentage and per-bill caps

### 3. Sales Processing Integration (✅ Enhanced)
- **Discount Selection Data**: New `applyDiscount` flag and `selectedDiscount` details stored with sales
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing `discountType` field for compatibility
- **Proper Reset Logic**: Clears discount selection states after successful sale

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (StoreManagerSales.jsx)

#### New State Variables
```javascript
const [applyDiscount, setApplyDiscount] = useState(false);
const [selectedDiscount, setSelectedDiscount] = useState(null);
```

#### Enhanced Discount Calculation Logic
**Before**: Combined manual + automatic discount rules
```javascript
// Old logic: manual + auto-apply + per-bill cap
let discountAmount = manualDiscountAmount + autoDiscountAmount;
```

**After**: Only manual selection when checkbox checked
```javascript
// New logic: only when applyDiscount is true
if (applyDiscount) {
  if (selectedDiscount) {
    // Use selected discount type
  } else if (discount > 0) {
    // Use manual percentage discount
  }
}
```

#### New UI Components
- **Apply Discount Checkbox**: With disabled state handling and discount count display
- **Conditional Dropdown**: Appears only when checkbox is checked
- **Nested Manual Input**: Shows when no discount type selected within the discount section
- **Enhanced Information Display**: Shows selected discount details with proper styling

#### Enhanced Sales Processing
- Added `applyDiscount` flag to sale data
- Added `selectedDiscount` details for new system
- Maintained `discountType` for backward compatibility
- Updated discount amount calculation logic

### Key Logic Changes

#### Discount Calculation Flow
1. **Check Apply Discount**: Only proceed if `applyDiscount` is true
2. **Selected Discount Type**: Use configured discount with caps
3. **Manual Discount Fallback**: Use percentage input when no type selected
4. **Apply Store Caps**: Respect store-level discount limits
5. **Zero When Unchecked**: No discount applied when checkbox unchecked

#### UI State Management
- **Checkbox Controls All**: Unchecking clears all discount selections
- **Dropdown Conditional**: Only visible when checkbox checked
- **Manual Input Nested**: Only shows when no discount type selected
- **Proper Reset**: All states cleared after successful sale

## User Experience Flow

### Discount Selection Workflow
1. Store Manager adds items to cart
2. Checks "Apply Discount" if discount should be applied
3. Selects specific discount type from dropdown OR uses manual percentage
4. Reviews discount breakdown in totals section
5. Processes sale with selected discount applied

### No Discount Workflow
1. Store Manager adds items to cart
2. Leaves "Apply Discount" checkbox unchecked
3. Processes sale with no discount applied
4. Clean transaction with zero discount amount

## Key Benefits
