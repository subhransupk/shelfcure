# Low Stock Items Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The Store Dashboard's "Low Stock Items" card was displaying incorrect data due to **inconsistent low stock calculation logic** across different endpoints and **missing `isActive: true` filter** in the dashboard endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Found:

1. **Missing `isActive: true` filter in Dashboard endpoint** - The dashboard was counting inactive/deleted medicines as low stock
2. **Inconsistent dual-unit logic** - Different endpoints used different rules for when both strips and individual units are enabled
3. **Legacy field handling** - Inconsistent support for old inventory structure across endpoints
4. **Code duplication** - Same complex aggregation logic repeated in multiple places

### Affected Endpoints:

- **Dashboard endpoint** (`/api/store-manager/dashboard`) - Missing `isActive` filter
- **Analytics endpoint** (`/api/store-manager/analytics`) - Different logic than dashboard
- **Inventory endpoint** (`/api/store-manager/inventory`) - Different aggregation approach
- **Analytics route** (`/api/analytics/admin/inventory`) - Yet another approach
- **AI Data Service** - Outdated logic using old field names

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Standardized Service (`LowStockService`)

**File:** `shelfcure-backend/services/lowStockService.js`

**Features:**
- Unified low stock calculation logic
- Proper `isActive: true` filtering
- Support for dual unit system business rules
- Legacy compatibility
- Multiple query methods (aggregation, find, count)

**Business Rules Implemented:**
1. **Both strips and individual enabled** → Low stock based on STRIP STOCK ONLY
2. **Only strips enabled** → Use strip stock vs strip minStock
3. **Only individual enabled** → Use individual stock vs individual minStock
4. **Legacy support** → Fall back to old inventory fields
5. **Active medicines only** → Always filter `isActive: true`

### 2. Updated All Endpoints

**Files Modified:**
- `shelfcure-backend/controllers/storeManagerController.js`
- `shelfcure-backend/routes/analytics.js`
- `shelfcure-backend/services/aiDataService.js`
- `shelfcure-backend/models/Medicine.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced complex aggregation logic with standardized service calls
- Added missing `isActive: true` filters
- Ensured consistent calculation across all endpoints
- Updated virtual fields and static methods

### 3. Key Methods in LowStockService

```javascript
// Count low stock medicines
LowStockService.countLowStockMedicines(storeId)

// Find low stock medicines with options
LowStockService.findLowStockMedicines(storeId, options)

// Get aggregation pipeline
LowStockService.getLowStockAggregationPipeline(additionalMatch)

// Get query object for find/countDocuments
LowStockService.getLowStockQuery(additionalMatch)

// Check individual medicine
LowStockService.isLowStock(medicine)
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test-lowstock-fix.js`) that validates:
- ✅ All calculation methods use consistent logic
- ✅ `isActive` filter is properly applied
- ✅ Dual unit system rules work correctly
- ✅ Legacy support is maintained
- ✅ Individual medicine checks are accurate

**Test Results:** All tests passed successfully.

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Dashboard showed incorrect low stock count (included inactive medicines)
- Different endpoints returned different results
- Inconsistent business logic implementation
- Code duplication and maintenance issues

### After Fix:
- ✅ Consistent low stock calculation across all endpoints
- ✅ Proper filtering of active medicines only
- ✅ Standardized business rules implementation
- ✅ Maintainable, centralized logic
- ✅ Accurate Store Dashboard "Low Stock Items" card

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the backend server**
2. **Access Store Dashboard** - Check "Low Stock Items" card shows accurate count
3. **Compare with inventory data** - Verify count matches actual low stock medicines
4. **Test other endpoints** - Ensure analytics and inventory pages show consistent data
5. **Test edge cases** - Verify inactive medicines are excluded

## Files Changed

### New Files:
- `shelfcure-backend/services/lowStockService.js` - Standardized service
- `shelfcure-backend/test-lowstock-fix.js` - Test suite
- `LOW_STOCK_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `shelfcure-backend/controllers/storeManagerController.js` - Updated 3 endpoints
- `shelfcure-backend/routes/analytics.js` - Updated analytics calculation
- `shelfcure-backend/services/aiDataService.js` - Updated AI service method
- `shelfcure-backend/models/Medicine.js` - Updated virtual field and static method

## Business Rules Clarification

The fix implements the correct ShelfCure dual unit system logic:

**When both strips and individual units are enabled:**
- Individual stock represents "cut medicines" from strips
- Low stock calculation uses STRIP STOCK ONLY
- Individual stock is not considered for low stock alerts

This prevents false low stock alerts when strips are available but individual units are low due to cutting strips for individual sales.

## Maintenance

The centralized `LowStockService` makes future maintenance easier:
- Single place to update business logic
- Consistent behavior across all endpoints
- Easy to add new features or modify rules
- Better testability and debugging
